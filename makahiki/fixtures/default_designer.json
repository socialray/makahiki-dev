Every lounge is assigned a daily energy goal that represents a 5% reduction in electricity use from what the lounge was using before the competition. The Energy Goal Game shows how much energy your lounge has used so far today, and how that compares to the energy goal. The game also shows some activities that might be helpful in getting your lounge to reduce its energy use.\r\n\r\nFor this activity, you will check out the [Go Low](/energy) page. Read the page over, and come back to here and report three things: is your lounge above or below the energy goal, by how much, and name one activity that might help your lounge conserve energy."
