For refrigerators, monitor their energy consumption for 30 minutes, then multiply by 48 to get an estimate of its total consumption for 24 hours. For microwaves, monitor its energy consumption during a 1 minute period, then multiply by the number of minutes per day that you and your roommate typically use it. Do the same for your other appliances: computer, Xbox, fans, etc.\r\n3. To receive credit for this activity, submit a list of the appliances in your room, your estimate of the energy each of them consume per day, and the total amount of energy your entire room uses per day (in watt-hours or kilowatt-hours). Remember to include an estimate for the overhead light if you use it. Are you surprised by this data?"

For this activity, you will create a **photo blog** around one of the subjects used as categories in the Smart Grid such as energy, lighting, or transportation. Note that this activity will require significantly more effort than normal activities, but it is also worth more points. This activity is worth a variable number of points, so the more effort and the higher quality of your photo blog, the more points you will receive.\r\n\r\nA photo blog is a series of photographs on a particular subject, possibly with some explanatory text on each photo. You will need to find a place to host your photo blog, some options are: [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/), [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/), or [Wordpress](http://wordpress.com/). Remember to pick a theme for your photos related to the Kukui Cup. Here are some starter ideas:\r\n\r\n* Pictures of things using electricity across campus\r\n* Pictures of energy generators (harder to find)\r\n* Pictures of trash across campus (litter, recycling, dumpsters)\r\n* Pictures of the different types of lighting used across campus\r\n* Or something else Kukui Cup-related"

Have an hour to walk around campus and learn about UH energy and sustainability projects? Then you're all set!\r\n\r\nHere's the deal: you'll use your smartphone (and your own smarts) to follow a trail of clues around campus and discover eight different locations related to energy or sustainability. Each location is tagged with a special Kukui Cup sign so you'll know when you've found it. Once there, take a picture of yourself with the sign in the background for verification, and upload to [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/). You will earn 5 Kukui Cup points for each location you find.  The sign also contains a URL that you can retrieve to obtain directions to the next location.\r\n\r\nReady?  Here's the first clue (you'll want to open it on your smartphone): [http://goo.gl/psXER](http://goo.gl/psXER)\r\n\r\nWhen you are done, come back here, click **I Did This!** and provide us with a link to your Flickr account so we can verify your trek."

The art should have some relationship to the theme of the Kukui Cup: use your imagination. To receive credit for this activity, take a picture of it (preferably at night) and include some text describing what your art is about. The more amazing, creative, and energy-related your window art, the more points you can earn. Since you still want to save energy, we recommend that you light up your art between 9-9:15 PM, you don't need to keep it lit all night long.\r\n\r\nAnother way to get more points for this activity is to enlist your neighbors beside you, above you, or below you to create a coordinated group window art effort. Take a photo of all of the windows, then tell us in the description which one is yours.\r\n\r\nThe more awesome your art, the closer to 50 points you'll earn.\r\n"

To do this, you will need a large container with a known volume (like a water bottle or bucket) that you can fill in the shower, and a clock of some type (like your watch or cell phone). Make sure to not get your clock wet if it isn't waterproof!\r\n\r\nHold the container up to the shower head, turn on the shower faucet to the level you use normally when showering, and note the time on the clock (or use a stopwatch). Watch the container fill, and note the time when it is completely full of water.\r\n\r\nNow you know the volume of water that the shower put out, and the amount of time it was running. From these two values, you can compute the flow rate of your shower by dividing the volume by the number of seconds it took to fill. For example, if you filled a 1 gallon bucket and it took 30 seconds, then the flow rate is 2 gallons per minute.\r\n\r\nAs you will see, water comes out of shower heads pretty fast, which is why it is important to turn off the water when you aren't actively using it, like while soaping up."

Both you and they will earn 10 extra points as soon as the new user earns 30 points with regular game play. There is **NO LIMIT** to the number of times you can earn a referral bonus, so start signing up your friends now!\r\n\r\nTo help you get started, you can earn five extra points for one of your referrals by completing this activity.

You do not have to wait for your first referral to complete before getting new referrals.   Nor do you have to even do this activity at all in order to get referral bonuses.  So, go out there, get as many new players to sign up and enter your email as possible, and you will get 10 points each time they achieve 30 points.

To do this, you will need a large container with a known volume (like a water bottle or bucket) that you can fit in the sink, and a clock of some type (like your watch or cell phone). Make sure to keep your clock dry if it isn't waterproof!\r\n\r\nHold the container up to the faucet in the sink, turn on the water to the level you use normally when using the sink, and note the time on the clock (or use a stopwatch). Watch the container fill, and note the time when it is completely full of water.\r\n\r\nNow you know the volume of water that the sink put out, and the amount of time it was running. From these two values, you can compute the flow rate of your sink by dividing the volume by the number of seconds it took to fill. For example, if you filled a 1 gallon bucket and it took 30 seconds, then the flow rate is 2 gallons per minute.\r\n\r\nAs you will see, water comes out of faucets pretty fast, which is why it is important to turn off the water when you aren't actively using it, like while brushing your teeth."

You will probably want to record your interview so that you can refer to it later, but make sure you ask your subject if recording them is OK!\r\n\r\nYour resulting interview can be written (like you might see in a magazine), and audio recording, or even a video.
